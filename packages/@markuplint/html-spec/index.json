					"description": "A Boolean attribute: if specified, the audio will automatically begin playback as soon as it can do so, without waiting for the entire audio file to finish downloading. Note: Sites that automatically play audio (or videos with an audio track) can be an unpleasant experience for users, so should be avoided when possible. If you must offer autoplay functionality, you should make it opt-in (requiring a user to specifically enable it). However, this can be useful when creating media elements whose source will be set at a later time, under user control. See our autoplay guide for additional information about how to properly use autoplay. If this attribute is present, the browser will offer controls to allow the user to control audio playback, including volume, seeking, and pause/resume playback.This enumerated attribute indicates whether to use CORS to fetch the related audio file. CORS-enabled resources can be reused in the <canvas> element without being tainted. The allowed values are: anonymous Sends a cross-origin request without a credential. In other words, it sends the Origin: HTTP header without a cookie, X.509 certificate, or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (by not setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: HTTP header), the image will be tainted, and its usage restricted. use-credentials Sends a cross-origin request with a credential. In other words, it sends the Origin: HTTP header with a cookie, a certificate, or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (through Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: HTTP header), the image will be tainted and its usage restricted. When not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS request (i.e. without sending the Origin: HTTP header), preventing its non-tainted used in <canvas> elements. If invalid, it is handled as if the enumerated keyword anonymous was used. See CORS settings attributes for additional information. Reading currentTime returns a double-precision floating-point value indicating the current playback position, in seconds, of the audio. If the audio's metadata isn't available yet—thereby preventing you from knowing the media's start time or duration—currentTime instead indicates, and can be used to change, the time at which playback will begin. Otherwise, setting currentTime sets the current playback position to the given time and seeks the media to that position if the media is currently loaded. If the audio is being streamed, it's possible that the user agent may not be able to obtain some parts of the resource if that data has expired from the media buffer. Other audio may have a media timeline that doesn't start at 0 seconds, so setting currentTime to a time before that would fail. For example, if the audio's media timeline starts at 12 hours, setting currentTime to 3600 would be an attempt to set the current playback position well before the beginning of the media, and would fail. The getStartDate() method can be used to determine the beginning point of the media timeline's reference frame. A Boolean attribute used to disable the capability of remote playback in devices that are attached using wired (HDMI, DVI, etc.) and wireless technologies (Miracast, Chromecast, DLNA, AirPlay, etc). See this proposed specification for more information. In Safari, you can use x-webkit-airplay=\"deny\" as a fallback.

Navigations on the same origin will still include the path. same-origin: A referrer will be sent for same origin, but cross-origin requests will contain no referrer information. strict-origin: Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP). strict-origin-when-cross-origin: Send a full URL when performing a same-origin request, only send the origin when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP). unsafe-url: The referrer will include the origin and the path (but not the fragment, password, or username).

					"description": "Defines an alternative text description of the image. Note: Browsers do not always display images. There are a number of situations in which a browser might not display images, such as: Non-visual browsers (such as those used by people with visual impairments) The user chooses not to display images (saving bandwidth, privacy reasons) The image is invalid or an unsupported type In these cases, the browser may replace the image with the text in the element's alt attribute. For these reasons and others, provide a useful value for alt whenever possible. Omitting alt altogether indicates that the image is a key part of the content and no textual equivalent is available. Setting this attribute to an empty string (alt=\"\") indicates that this image is not a key part of the content (it’s decoration or a tracking pixel), and that non-visual browsers may omit it from rendering. Visual browsers will also hide the broken image icon if the alt is empty and the image failed to display. This attribute is also used when copying and pasting the image to text, or saving a linked image to a bookmark. Indicates if the fetching of the image must be done using a CORS request. Image data from a CORS-enabled image returned from a CORS request can be reused in the <canvas> element without being marked \"tainted\". If the crossorigin attribute is not specified, then a non-CORS request is sent (without the Origin request header), and the browser marks the image as tainted and restricts access to its image data, preventing its usage in <canvas> elements. If the crossorigin attribute is specified, then a CORS request is sent (with the Origin request header); but if the server does not opt into allowing cross-origin access to the image data by the origin site (by not sending any Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header, or by not including the site's origin in any Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header it does send), then the browser marks the image as tainted and restricts access to its image data, preventing its usage in <canvas> elements. Allowed values: anonymous A CORS request is sent with credentials omitted (that is, no cookies, X.509 certificates, or Authorization request header). use-credentials The CORS request is sent with any credentials included (that is, cookies, X.509 certificates, and the Authorization request header). If the server does not opt into sharing credentials with the origin site (by sending back the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true response header), then the browser marks the image as tainted and restricts access to its image data. If the attribute has an invalid value, browsers handle it as if the anonymous value was used. See CORS settings attributes for additional information. Provides an image decoding hint to the browser. Allowed values: sync Decode the image synchronously, for atomic presentation with other content. async Decode the image asynchronously, to reduce delay in presenting other content. auto Default: no preference for the decoding mode. The browser decides what is best for the user. The intrinsic height of the image, in pixels. Must be an integer without a unit.Indicates the relative download importance of the resource. Priority hints allow the values: auto: no preference. The browser may use its own heuristics to prioritize the image. high: the image is of high priority. low: the image is of low priority. This attribute tells the browser to ignore the actual intrinsic size of the image and pretend it’s the size specified in the attribute. Specifically, the image would raster at these dimensions and naturalWidth/naturalHeight on images would return the values specified in this attribute. Explainer, examplesThis Boolean attribute indicates that the image is part of a server-side map. If so, the coordinates where the user clicked on the image are sent to the server. Note: This attribute is allowed only if the <img> element is a descendant of an <a> element with a valid href attribute. This gives users without pointing devices a fallback destination. Indicates how the browser should load the image: eager: Loads the image immediately, regardless of whether or not the image is currently within the visible viewport (this is the default value). lazy: Defers loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport, as defined by the browser. The intent is to avoid the network and storage bandwidth needed to handle the image until it's reasonably certain that it will be needed. This generally improves the performance of the content in most typical use cases. Note: Loading is only deferred when JavaScript is enabled. This is an anti-tracking measure, because if a user agent supported lazy loading when scripting is disabled, it would still be possible for a site to track a user's approximate scroll position throughout a session, by strategically placing images in a page's markup such that a server can track how many images are requested and when. A string indicating which referrer to use when fetching the resource: no-referrer: The Referer header will not be sent. no-referrer-when-downgrade: No Referer header is sent when navigating to an origin without HTTPS. This is the default if no policy is otherwise specified. origin: The Referer header will include the page's origin (scheme, host, and port). origin-when-cross-origin: Navigating to other origins will limit the included referral data to the scheme, host, and port, while navigating from the same origin will include the full path and query string. unsafe-url: The Referer header will always include the origin, path and query string, but not the fragment, password, or username. This is unsafe because it can leak information from TLS-protected resources to insecure origins. One or more strings separated by commas, indicating a set of source sizes. Each source size consists of: A media condition. This must be omitted for the last item in the list. A source size value. Media Conditions describe properties of the viewport, not of the image. For example, (max-height: 500px) 1000px proposes to use a source of 1000px width, if the viewport is not higher than 500px. Source size values specify the intended display size of the image. User agents use the current source size to select one of the sources supplied by the srcset attribute, when those sources are described using width (w) descriptors. The selected source size affects the intrinsic size of the image (the image’s display size if no CSS styling is applied). If the srcset attribute is absent, or contains no values with a width descriptor, then the sizes attribute has no effect. The image URL. Mandatory for the <img> element. On browsers supporting srcset, src is treated like a candidate image with a pixel density descriptor 1x, unless an image with this pixel density descriptor is already defined in srcset, or unless srcset contains w descriptors.One or more strings separated by commas, indicating possible image sources for the user agent to use. Each string is composed of: A URL to an image Optionally, whitespace followed by one of: A width descriptor (a positive integer directly followed by w).

If the crossorigin attribute is specified, then a CORS request is sent (with the Origin request header); but if the server does not opt into allowing cross-origin access to the image data by the origin site (by not sending any Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header, or by not including the site's origin in any Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header it does send), then the browser marks the image as tainted and restricts access to its image data, preventing its usage in <canvas> elements. Allowed values: anonymous A CORS request is sent with credentials omitted (that is, no cookies, X.509 certificates, or Authorization request header). use-credentials The CORS request is sent with any credentials included (that is, cookies, X.509 certificates, and the Authorization request header). If the server does not opt into sharing credentials with the origin site (by sending back the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true response header), then the browser marks the image as tainted and restricts access to its image data.

					"description": "Valid for the file input type only, the accept attribute defines which file types are selectable in a file upload control. See the file input type. Valid for the image button only, the alt attribute provides alternative text for the image, displaying the value of the attribute if the image src is missing or otherwise fails to load. See the image input type. (Not a Boolean attribute!) The autocomplete attribute takes as its value a space-separated string that describes what, if any, type of autocomplete functionality the input should provide. A typical implementation of autocomplete simply recalls previous values entered in the same input field, but more complex forms of autocomplete can exist. For instance, a browser could integrate with a device's contacts list to autocomplete email addresses in an email input field. See Values in The HTML autocomplete attribute for permitted values. The autocomplete attribute is valid on hidden, text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, color, and password. This attribute has no effect on input types that do not return numeric or text data, being valid for all input types except checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. See The HTML autocomplete attribute for additional information, including information on password security and how autocomplete is slightly different for hidden than for other input types. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the input should automatically have focus when the page has finished loading (or when the <dialog> containing the element has been displayed). Note: An element with the autofocus attribute may gain focus before the DOMContentLoaded event is fired. No more than one element in the document may have the autofocus attribute. If put on more than one element, the first one with the attribute receives focus. The autofocus attribute cannot be used on inputs of type hidden, since hidden inputs cannot be focused. Warning: Automatically focusing a form control can confuse visually-impaired people using screen-reading technology and people with cognitive impairments. When autofocus is assigned, screen-readers \"teleport\" their user to the form control without warning them beforehand. Use careful consideration for accessibility when applying the autofocus attribute. Automatically focusing on a control can cause the page to scroll on load. The focus can also cause dynamic keyboards to display on some touch devices. While a screen reader will announce the label of the form control receiving focus, the screen reader will not announce anything before the label, and the sighted user on a small device will equally miss the context created by the preceding content. Introduced in the HTML Media Capture specification and valid for the file input type only, the capture attribute defines which media—microphone, video, or camera—should be used to capture a new file for upload with file upload control in supporting scenarios. See the file input type. Valid for both radio and checkbox types, checked is a Boolean attribute. If present on a radio type, it indicates that that radio button is the currently selected one in the group of same-named radio buttons. If present on a checkbox type, it indicates that the checkbox is checked by default (when the page loads). It does not indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked: if the checkbox’s state is changed, this content attribute does not reflect the change. (Only the HTMLInputElement’s checked IDL attribute is updated.) Note: Unlike other input controls, a checkboxes and radio buttons value are only included in the submitted data if they are currently checked. If they are, the name and the value(s) of the checked controls are submitted. For example, if a checkbox whose name is fruit has a value of cherry, and the checkbox is checked, the form data submitted will include fruit=cherry. If the checkbox isn't active, it isn't listed in the form data at all. The default value for checkboxes and radio buttons is on. Valid for text and search input types only, the dirname attribute enables the submission of the directionality of the element. When included, the form control will submit with two name/value pairs: the first being the name and value, the second being the value of the dirname as the name with the value of ltr or rtl being set by the browser. <form action=\"page.html\" method=\"post\"> <label>Fruit: <input type=\"text\" name=\"fruit\" dirname=\"fruit.dir\" value=\"cherry\"></label> <input type=\"submit\"/> </form> <!-- page.html?fruit=cherry&fruit.dir=ltr --> When the form above is submitted, the input cause both the name / value pair of fruit=cherry and the dirname / direction pair of fruit.dir=ltr to be sent. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to interact with the input. Disabled inputs are typically rendered with a dimmer color or using some other form of indication that the field is not available for use. Specifically, disabled inputs do not receive the click event, and disabled inputs are not submitted with the form. Note: Although not required by the specification, Firefox will by default persist the dynamic disabled state of an <input> across page loads. Use the autocomplete attribute to control this feature. A string specifying the <form> element with which the input is associated (that is, its form owner). This string's value, if present, must match the id of a <form> element in the same document. If this attribute isn't specified, the <input> element is associated with the nearest containing form, if any. The form attribute lets you place an input anywhere in the document but have it included with a form elsewhere in the document. Note: An input can only be associated with one form. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image input button only, the height is the height of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, it defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking. The value is used as the value of the <label>'s for attribute to link the label with the form control. See <label>. Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers as to the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Values include none, text, tel, url, email, numeric, decimal, and search. The value given to the list attribute should be. the id of a <datalist> element located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value. <datalist id=\"colorsxx\"> <option>#ff0000</option> <option>#ee0000</option> <option>#dd0000</option> <option>#cc0000</option> <option>#bb0000</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"numbersxx\"> <option>0</option> <option>2</option> <option>4</option> <option>8</option> <option>16</option> <option>32</option> <option>64</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"fruitsxx\"> <option>cherry</option> <option>banana</option> <option>mango</option> <option>orange</option> <option>blueberry</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"urlsxx\"> <option>https://developer.mozilla.org</option> <option>https://caniuse.com/</option> <option>https://mozilla.com</option> <option>https://mdn.github.io</option> <option>https://www.youtube.com/user/firefoxchannel</option> </datalist> <p><label for=\"textx\">Text</label> <input type=\"text\" list=\"fruitsxx\" id=\"textx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"colorx\">Color</label> <input type=\"color\" list=\"colorsxx\" id=\"colorx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"rangex\">Range</label> <input type=\"range\" min=\"0\" max=\"64\" list=\"numbersxx\" id=\"rangex\"/></p> <p><label for=\"numberx\">Number</label> <input type=\"number\" min=\"0\" max=\"64\" list=\"numbersxx\" id=\"numberx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"urlx\">URL</label> <input type=\"url\" list=\"urlsxx\" id=\"urlx\"/></p> It is valid on text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, and color. Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control's value when the form data is submitted. What's in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input's value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\"form\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\"hat-size\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is \"First Name\", a suitable placeholder might be \"e.g. Mustafa\". Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text, it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default value of 20, and for others, it is pixels. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\"number\" min=\"10\" step=\"2\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\"number\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\"number\" min=\"-5.2\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The step attribute is expressed in seconds. The step scale factor is 1000 (which converts the seconds to milliseconds, as used in the other algorithms). The default step is 60 seconds. See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control's id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control's value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object's value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden.

See the image input type. (Not a Boolean attribute!) The autocomplete attribute takes as its value a space-separated string that describes what, if any, type of autocomplete functionality the input should provide. A typical implementation of autocomplete simply recalls previous values entered in the same input field, but more complex forms of autocomplete can exist. For instance, a browser could integrate with a device's contacts list to autocomplete email addresses in an email input field. See Values in The HTML autocomplete attribute for permitted values. The autocomplete attribute is valid on hidden, text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, color, and password. This attribute has no effect on input types that do not return numeric or text data, being valid for all input types except checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. See The HTML autocomplete attribute for additional information, including information on password security and how autocomplete is slightly different for hidden than for other input types. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the input should automatically have focus when the page has finished loading (or when the <dialog> containing the element has been displayed). Note: An element with the autofocus attribute may gain focus before the DOMContentLoaded event is fired. No more than one element in the document may have the autofocus attribute. If put on more than one element, the first one with the attribute receives focus. The autofocus attribute cannot be used on inputs of type hidden, since hidden inputs cannot be focused. Warning: Automatically focusing a form control can confuse visually-impaired people using screen-reading technology and people with cognitive impairments. When autofocus is assigned, screen-readers \"teleport\" their user to the form control without warning them beforehand. Use careful consideration for accessibility when applying the autofocus attribute. Automatically focusing on a control can cause the page to scroll on load. The focus can also cause dynamic keyboards to display on some touch devices. While a screen reader will announce the label of the form control receiving focus, the screen reader will not announce anything before the label, and the sighted user on a small device will equally miss the context created by the preceding content. Introduced in the HTML Media Capture specification and valid for the file input type only, the capture attribute defines which media—microphone, video, or camera—should be used to capture a new file for upload with file upload control in supporting scenarios. See the file input type. Valid for both radio and checkbox types, checked is a Boolean attribute. If present on a radio type, it indicates that that radio button is the currently selected one in the group of same-named radio buttons. If present on a checkbox type, it indicates that the checkbox is checked by default (when the page loads). It does not indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked: if the checkbox’s state is changed, this content attribute does not reflect the change. (Only the HTMLInputElement’s checked IDL attribute is updated.) Note: Unlike other input controls, a checkboxes and radio buttons value are only included in the submitted data if they are currently checked. If they are, the name and the value(s) of the checked controls are submitted. For example, if a checkbox whose name is fruit has a value of cherry, and the checkbox is checked, the form data submitted will include fruit=cherry. If the checkbox isn't active, it isn't listed in the form data at all. The default value for checkboxes and radio buttons is on. Valid for text and search input types only, the dirname attribute enables the submission of the directionality of the element. When included, the form control will submit with two name/value pairs: the first being the name and value, the second being the value of the dirname as the name with the value of ltr or rtl being set by the browser. <form action=\"page.html\" method=\"post\"> <label>Fruit: <input type=\"text\" name=\"fruit\" dirname=\"fruit.dir\" value=\"cherry\"></label> <input type=\"submit\"/> </form> <!-- page.html?fruit=cherry&fruit.dir=ltr --> When the form above is submitted, the input cause both the name / value pair of fruit=cherry and the dirname / direction pair of fruit.dir=ltr to be sent. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to interact with the input. Disabled inputs are typically rendered with a dimmer color or using some other form of indication that the field is not available for use. Specifically, disabled inputs do not receive the click event, and disabled inputs are not submitted with the form. Note: Although not required by the specification, Firefox will by default persist the dynamic disabled state of an <input> across page loads. Use the autocomplete attribute to control this feature. A string specifying the <form> element with which the input is associated (that is, its form owner). This string's value, if present, must match the id of a <form> element in the same document. If this attribute isn't specified, the <input> element is associated with the nearest containing form, if any. The form attribute lets you place an input anywhere in the document but have it included with a form elsewhere in the document. Note: An input can only be associated with one form. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information.

Valid for the image input button only, the height is the height of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, it defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking. The value is used as the value of the <label>'s for attribute to link the label with the form control. See <label>. Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers as to the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Values include none, text, tel, url, email, numeric, decimal, and search. The value given to the list attribute should be. the id of a <datalist> element located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value. <datalist id=\"colorsxx\"> <option>#ff0000</option> <option>#ee0000</option> <option>#dd0000</option> <option>#cc0000</option> <option>#bb0000</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"numbersxx\"> <option>0</option> <option>2</option> <option>4</option> <option>8</option> <option>16</option> <option>32</option> <option>64</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"fruitsxx\"> <option>cherry</option> <option>banana</option> <option>mango</option> <option>orange</option> <option>blueberry</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"urlsxx\"> <option>https://developer.mozilla.org</option> <option>https://caniuse.com/</option> <option>https://mozilla.com</option> <option>https://mdn.github.io</option> <option>https://www.youtube.com/user/firefoxchannel</option> </datalist> <p><label for=\"textx\">Text</label> <input type=\"text\" list=\"fruitsxx\" id=\"textx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"colorx\">Color</label> <input type=\"color\" list=\"colorsxx\" id=\"colorx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"rangex\">Range</label> <input type=\"range\" min=\"0\" max=\"64\" list=\"numbersxx\" id=\"rangex\"/></p> <p><label for=\"numberx\">Number</label> <input type=\"number\" min=\"0\" max=\"64\" list=\"numbersxx\" id=\"numberx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"urlx\">URL</label> <input type=\"url\" list=\"urlsxx\" id=\"urlx\"/></p> It is valid on text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, and color. Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control's value when the form data is submitted. What's in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input's value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\"form\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\"hat-size\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is \"First Name\", a suitable placeholder might be \"e.g. Mustafa\". Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text, it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default value of 20, and for others, it is pixels. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\"number\" min=\"10\" step=\"2\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\"number\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\"number\" min=\"-5.2\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The step attribute is expressed in seconds. The step scale factor is 1000 (which converts the seconds to milliseconds, as used in the other algorithms). The default step is 60 seconds. See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control's id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control's value.

Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\"form\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\"hat-size\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is \"First Name\", a suitable placeholder might be \"e.g. Mustafa\". Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text, it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default value of 20, and for others, it is pixels. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\"number\" min=\"10\" step=\"2\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\"number\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\"number\" min=\"-5.2\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The step attribute is expressed in seconds. The step scale factor is 1000 (which converts the seconds to milliseconds, as used in the other algorithms). The default step is 60 seconds. See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control's id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control's value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object's value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden. Valid for the image input button only, the width is the width of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type.",

Permitted values are: on Enable automatic correction of typos, as well as processing of text substitutions if any are configured. off Disable automatic correction and text substitutions. The Boolean attribute incremental is a WebKit and Blink extension (so supported by Safari, Opera, Chrome, etc.) which, if present, tells the user agent to process the input as a live search. As the user edits the value of the field, the user agent sends search events to the HTMLInputElement object representing the search box. This allows your code to update the search results in real time as the user edits the search. If incremental is not specified, the search event is only sent when the user explicitly initiates a search (such as by pressing the Enter or Return key while editing the field). The search event is rate-limited so that it is not sent more more frequently than an implementation-defined interval.A Mozilla extension, supported by Firefox for Android, which provides a hint as to what sort of action will be taken if the user presses the Enter or Return key while editing the field. This information is used to decide what kind of label to use on the Enter key on the virtual keyboard. Note: This has been standardized as the global attribute enterkeyhint, but is not yet widely implemented. To see the status of the change being implemented in Firefox, see bug 1490661. Permitted values are: go, done, next, search, and send. The browser decides, using this hint, what label to put on the enter key.The results attribute—supported only by Safari—is a numeric value that lets you override the maximum number of entries to be displayed in the <input> element's natively-provided drop-down menu of previous search queries. The value must be a non-negative decimal number. If not provided, or an invalid value is given, the browser's default maximum number of entries is used.The Boolean webkitdirectory attribute, if present, indicates that only directories should be available to be selected by the user in the file picker interface.

					"name": "autofocus",
					"type": "String",
					"description": "A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the input should automatically have focus when the page has finished loading (or when the <dialog> containing the element has been displayed). Note: An element with the autofocus attribute may gain focus before the DOMContentLoaded event is fired. No more than one element in the document may have the autofocus attribute. If put on more than one element, the first one with the attribute receives focus. The autofocus attribute cannot be used on inputs of type hidden, since hidden inputs cannot be focused. Warning: Automatically focusing a form control can confuse visually-impaired people using screen-reading technology and people with cognitive impairments. When autofocus is assigned, screen-readers \"teleport\" their user to the form control without warning them beforehand. Use careful consideration for accessibility when applying the autofocus attribute. Automatically focusing on a control can cause the page to scroll on load. The focus can also cause dynamic keyboards to display on some touch devices. While a screen reader will announce the label of the form control receiving focus, the screen reader will not announce anything before the label, and the sighted user on a small device will equally miss the context created by the preceding content. Introduced in the HTML Media Capture specification and valid for the file input type only, the capture attribute defines which media—microphone, video, or camera—should be used to capture a new file for upload with file upload control in supporting scenarios. See the file input type. Valid for both radio and checkbox types, checked is a Boolean attribute. If present on a radio type, it indicates that that radio button is the currently selected one in the group of same-named radio buttons. If present on a checkbox type, it indicates that the checkbox is checked by default (when the page loads). It does not indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked: if the checkbox’s state is changed, this content attribute does not reflect the change. (Only the HTMLInputElement’s checked IDL attribute is updated.) Note: Unlike other input controls, a checkboxes and radio buttons value are only included in the submitted data if they are currently checked. If they are, the name and the value(s) of the checked controls are submitted. For example, if a checkbox whose name is fruit has a value of cherry, and the checkbox is checked, the form data submitted will include fruit=cherry. If the checkbox isn't active, it isn't listed in the form data at all. The default value for checkboxes and radio buttons is on. Valid for text and search input types only, the dirname attribute enables the submission of the directionality of the element. When included, the form control will submit with two name/value pairs: the first being the name and value, the second being the value of the dirname as the name with the value of ltr or rtl being set by the browser. <form action=\"page.html\" method=\"post\"> <label>Fruit: <input type=\"text\" name=\"fruit\" dirname=\"fruit.dir\" value=\"cherry\"></label> <input type=\"submit\"/> </form> <!-- page.html?fruit=cherry&fruit.dir=ltr --> When the form above is submitted, the input cause both the name / value pair of fruit=cherry and the dirname / direction pair of fruit.dir=ltr to be sent. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to interact with the input. Disabled inputs are typically rendered with a dimmer color or using some other form of indication that the field is not available for use. Specifically, disabled inputs do not receive the click event, and disabled inputs are not submitted with the form. Note: Although not required by the specification, Firefox will by default persist the dynamic disabled state of an <input> across page loads. Use the autocomplete attribute to control this feature. A string specifying the <form> element with which the input is associated (that is, its form owner). This string's value, if present, must match the id of a <form> element in the same document. If this attribute isn't specified, the <input> element is associated with the nearest containing form, if any. The form attribute lets you place an input anywhere in the document but have it included with a form elsewhere in the document. Note: An input can only be associated with one form.

Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, it defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking. The value is used as the value of the <label>'s for attribute to link the label with the form control. See <label>. Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers as to the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Values include none, text, tel, url, email, numeric, decimal, and search. The value given to the list attribute should be. the id of a <datalist> element located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the suggested options.

Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control's value when the form data is submitted. What's in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.)

Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers as to the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Values include none, text, tel, url, email, numeric, decimal, and search. The value given to the list attribute should be. the id of a <datalist> element located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value. <datalist id=\"colorsxx\"> <option>#ff0000</option> <option>#ee0000</option> <option>#dd0000</option> <option>#cc0000</option> <option>#bb0000</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"numbersxx\"> <option>0</option> <option>2</option> <option>4</option> <option>8</option> <option>16</option> <option>32</option> <option>64</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"fruitsxx\"> <option>cherry</option> <option>banana</option> <option>mango</option> <option>orange</option> <option>blueberry</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"urlsxx\"> <option>https://developer.mozilla.org</option> <option>https://caniuse.com/</option> <option>https://mozilla.com</option> <option>https://mdn.github.io</option> <option>https://www.youtube.com/user/firefoxchannel</option> </datalist> <p><label for=\"textx\">Text</label> <input type=\"text\" list=\"fruitsxx\" id=\"textx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"colorx\">Color</label> <input type=\"color\" list=\"colorsxx\" id=\"colorx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"rangex\">Range</label> <input type=\"range\" min=\"0\" max=\"64\" list=\"numbersxx\" id=\"rangex\"/></p> <p><label for=\"numberx\">Number</label> <input type=\"number\" min=\"0\" max=\"64\" list=\"numbersxx\" id=\"numberx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"urlx\">URL</label> <input type=\"url\" list=\"urlsxx\" id=\"urlx\"/></p> It is valid on text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, and color. Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control's value when the form data is submitted. What's in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input's value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\"form\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\"hat-size\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is \"First Name\", a suitable placeholder might be \"e.g. Mustafa\". Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text, it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default value of 20, and for others, it is pixels. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\"number\" min=\"10\" step=\"2\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\"number\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\"number\" min=\"-5.2\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The step attribute is expressed in seconds. The step scale factor is 1000 (which converts the seconds to milliseconds, as used in the other algorithms). The default step is 60 seconds. See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control's id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control's value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object's value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden. Valid for the image input button only, the width is the width of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type."

If present on a radio type, it indicates that that radio button is the currently selected one in the group of same-named radio buttons. If present on a checkbox type, it indicates that the checkbox is checked by default (when the page loads). It does not indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked: if the checkbox’s state is changed, this content attribute does not reflect the change. (Only the HTMLInputElement’s checked IDL attribute is updated.) Note: Unlike other input controls, a checkboxes and radio buttons value are only included in the submitted data if they are currently checked. If they are, the name and the value(s) of the checked controls are submitted. For example, if a checkbox whose name is fruit has a value of cherry, and the checkbox is checked, the form data submitted will include fruit=cherry. If the checkbox isn't active, it isn't listed in the form data at all. The default value for checkboxes and radio buttons is on. Valid for text and search input types only, the dirname attribute enables the submission of the directionality of the element.

The form attribute lets you place an input anywhere in the document but have it included with a form elsewhere in the document. Note: An input can only be associated with one form. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information.

Valid for the image input button only, the height is the height of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, it defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking. The value is used as the value of the <label>'s for attribute to link the label with the form control. See <label>. Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers as to the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Values include none, text, tel, url, email, numeric, decimal, and search. The value given to the list attribute should be. the id of a <datalist> element located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value. <datalist id=\"colorsxx\"> <option>#ff0000</option> <option>#ee0000</option> <option>#dd0000</option> <option>#cc0000</option> <option>#bb0000</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"numbersxx\"> <option>0</option> <option>2</option> <option>4</option> <option>8</option> <option>16</option> <option>32</option> <option>64</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"fruitsxx\"> <option>cherry</option> <option>banana</option> <option>mango</option> <option>orange</option> <option>blueberry</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"urlsxx\"> <option>https://developer.mozilla.org</option> <option>https://caniuse.com/</option> <option>https://mozilla.com</option> <option>https://mdn.github.io</option> <option>https://www.youtube.com/user/firefoxchannel</option> </datalist> <p><label for=\"textx\">Text</label> <input type=\"text\" list=\"fruitsxx\" id=\"textx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"colorx\">Color</label> <input type=\"color\" list=\"colorsxx\" id=\"colorx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"rangex\">Range</label> <input type=\"range\" min=\"0\" max=\"64\" list=\"numbersxx\" id=\"rangex\"/></p> <p><label for=\"numberx\">Number</label> <input type=\"number\" min=\"0\" max=\"64\" list=\"numbersxx\" id=\"numberx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"urlx\">URL</label> <input type=\"url\" list=\"urlsxx\" id=\"urlx\"/></p> It is valid on text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, and color. Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control's value when the form data is submitted. What's in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input's value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\"form\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\"hat-size\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is \"First Name\", a suitable placeholder might be \"e.g. Mustafa\". Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text, it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default value of 20, and for others, it is pixels. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\"number\" min=\"10\" step=\"2\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\"number\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\"number\" min=\"-5.2\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The step attribute is expressed in seconds. The step scale factor is 1000 (which converts the seconds to milliseconds, as used in the other algorithms). The default step is 60 seconds. See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control's id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control's value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object's value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden. Valid for the image input button only, the width is the width of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type.",

The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value. <datalist id=\"colorsxx\"> <option>#ff0000</option> <option>#ee0000</option> <option>#dd0000</option> <option>#cc0000</option> <option>#bb0000</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"numbersxx\"> <option>0</option> <option>2</option> <option>4</option> <option>8</option> <option>16</option> <option>32</option> <option>64</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"fruitsxx\"> <option>cherry</option> <option>banana</option> <option>mango</option> <option>orange</option> <option>blueberry</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\"urlsxx\"> <option>https://developer.mozilla.org</option> <option>https://caniuse.com/</option> <option>https://mozilla.com</option> <option>https://mdn.github.io</option> <option>https://www.youtube.com/user/firefoxchannel</option> </datalist> <p><label for=\"textx\">Text</label> <input type=\"text\" list=\"fruitsxx\" id=\"textx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"colorx\">Color</label> <input type=\"color\" list=\"colorsxx\" id=\"colorx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"rangex\">Range</label> <input type=\"range\" min=\"0\" max=\"64\" list=\"numbersxx\" id=\"rangex\"/></p> <p><label for=\"numberx\">Number</label> <input type=\"number\" min=\"0\" max=\"64\" list=\"numbersxx\" id=\"numberx\"/></p> <p><label for=\"urlx\">URL</label> <input type=\"url\" list=\"urlsxx\" id=\"urlx\"/></p> It is valid on text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, and color. Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control's value when the form data is submitted. What's in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input's value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\"form\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\"hat-size\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is \"First Name\", a suitable placeholder might be \"e.g. Mustafa\". Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text, it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default value of 20, and for others, it is pixels. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\"number\" min=\"10\" step=\"2\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\"number\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\"number\" min=\"-5.2\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The step attribute is expressed in seconds. The step scale factor is 1000 (which converts the seconds to milliseconds, as used in the other algorithms). The default step is 60 seconds. See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control's id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control's value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object's value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden.

If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control's value when the form data is submitted. What's in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input's value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\"form\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\"hat-size\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is \"First Name\", a suitable placeholder might be \"e.g. Mustafa\". Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text, it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default value of 20, and for others, it is pixels. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\"number\" min=\"10\" step=\"2\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\"number\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\"number\" min=\"-5.2\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The step attribute is expressed in seconds. The step scale factor is 1000 (which converts the seconds to milliseconds, as used in the other algorithms). The default step is 60 seconds. See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control's id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control's value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object's value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden.

If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\"form\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\"hat-size\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is \"First Name\", a suitable placeholder might be \"e.g. Mustafa\". Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text, it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default value of 20, and for others, it is pixels. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\"number\" min=\"10\" step=\"2\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\"number\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\"number\" min=\"-5.2\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The step attribute is expressed in seconds. The step scale factor is 1000 (which converts the seconds to milliseconds, as used in the other algorithms). The default step is 60 seconds. See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control's id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control's value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object's value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden.

Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission.

This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control's value when the form data is submitted. What's in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input's value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus.

Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\"number\" min=\"10\" step=\"2\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\"number\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\"number\" min=\"-5.2\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The step attribute is expressed in seconds. The step scale factor is 1000 (which converts the seconds to milliseconds, as used in the other algorithms). The default step is 60 seconds. See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control's id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control's value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object's value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden. Valid for the image input button only, the width is the width of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type.",

Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control's value when the form data is submitted. What's in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input's value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\"form\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\"hat-size\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is \"First Name\", a suitable placeholder might be \"e.g. Mustafa\". Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted.

This allows your code to update the search results in real time as the user edits the search. If incremental is not specified, the search event is only sent when the user explicitly initiates a search (such as by pressing the Enter or Return key while editing the field).

Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control's value when the form data is submitted. What's in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input's value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\"form\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\"hat-size\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is \"First Name\", a suitable placeholder might be \"e.g. Mustafa\". Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text, it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default value of 20, and for others, it is pixels. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\"number\" min=\"10\" step=\"2\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\"number\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\"number\" min=\"-5.2\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The step attribute is expressed in seconds. The step scale factor is 1000 (which converts the seconds to milliseconds, as used in the other algorithms). The default step is 60 seconds. See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control's id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render.

The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text, it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default value of 20, and for others, it is pixels. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\"number\" min=\"10\" step=\"2\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\"number\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\"number\" min=\"-5.2\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The step attribute is expressed in seconds. The step scale factor is 1000 (which converts the seconds to milliseconds, as used in the other algorithms). The default step is 60 seconds. See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control's id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control's value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object's value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden.

If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control's value when the form data is submitted. What's in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input's value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\"form\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\"hat-size\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is \"First Name\", a suitable placeholder might be \"e.g. Mustafa\".

What's in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input's value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\"form\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\"hat-size\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is \"First Name\", a suitable placeholder might be \"e.g. Mustafa\". Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted.

Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text, it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default value of 20, and for others, it is pixels. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\"number\" min=\"10\" step=\"2\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\"number\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\"number\" min=\"-5.2\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass.

					"description": "Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text, it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default value of 20, and for others, it is pixels. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\"number\" min=\"10\" step=\"2\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\"number\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\"number\" min=\"-5.2\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The step attribute is expressed in seconds. The step scale factor is 1000 (which converts the seconds to milliseconds, as used in the other algorithms). The default step is 60 seconds.

If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (by not setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP header) the resource will be tainted and its usage restricted. use-credentials A cross-origin request (i.e. with an Origin HTTP header) is performed along with a credential sent (i.e. a cookie, certificate, and/or HTTP Basic authentication is performed). If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (through Access-Control-Allow-Credentials HTTP header), the resource will be tainted and its usage restricted. If the attribute is not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS request (i.e. without sending the Origin HTTP header), preventing its non-tainted usage. If invalid, it is handled as if the enumerated keyword anonymous was used. See CORS settings attributes for additional information. For rel=\"stylesheet\" only, the disabled Boolean attribute indicates whether or not the described stylesheet should be loaded and applied to the document. If disabled is specified in the HTML when it is loaded, the stylesheet will not be loaded during page load. Instead, the stylesheet will be loaded on-demand, if and when the disabled attribute is changed to false or removed.

This attribute must not be used if the src attribute is absent (i.e. for inline scripts), in this case it would have no effect. The defer attribute has no effect on module scripts — they defer by default. Scripts with the defer attribute will execute in the order in which they appear in the document. This attribute allows the elimination of parser-blocking JavaScript where the browser would have to load and evaluate scripts before continuing to parse. async has a similar effect in this case. This attribute contains inline metadata that a user agent can use to verify that a fetched resource has been delivered free of unexpected manipulation. See Subresource Integrity.This Boolean attribute is set to indicate that the script should not be executed in browsers that support ES2015 modules — in effect, this can be used to serve fallback scripts to older browsers that do not support modular JavaScript code.A cryptographic nonce (number used once) to whitelist scripts in a script-src Content-Security-Policy.

It is critical to provide a nonce that cannot be guessed as bypassing a resource's policy is otherwise trivial.Indicates which referrer to send when fetching the script, or resources fetched by the script: no-referrer: The Referer header will not be sent. no-referrer-when-downgrade (default): The Referer header will not be sent to origins without TLS (HTTPS). origin: The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page: its scheme, host, and port. origin-when-cross-origin: The referrer sent to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port. Navigations on the same origin will still include the path. same-origin: A referrer will be sent for same origin, but cross-origin requests will contain no referrer information. strict-origin: Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the protocol security level stays the same (e.g. HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination (e.g. HTTPS→HTTP). strict-origin-when-cross-origin: Send a full URL when performing a same-origin request, but only send the origin when the protocol security level stays the same (e.g.HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination (e.g. HTTPS→HTTP). unsafe-url: The referrer will include the origin and the path (but not the fragment, password, or username).

Possible values are: off: The user must explicitly enter a value into this field for every use, or the document provides its own auto-completion method; the browser does not automatically complete the entry. on: The browser can automatically complete the value based on values that the user has entered during previous uses. If the autocomplete attribute is not specified on a <textarea> element, then the browser uses the autocomplete attribute value of the <textarea> element's form owner. The form owner is either the <form> element that this <textarea> element is a descendant of or the form element whose id is specified by the form attribute of the input element. For more information, see the autocomplete attribute in <form>. This Boolean attribute lets you specify that a form control should have input focus when the page loads.
